# FEAScript-Scribbler-examples

This repository contains finite element [FEAScript](https://feascript.com/) examples designed to run on [Scribbler](https://scribbler.live/), an interactive JavaScript notebook tool with preloaded scientific libraries.

The examples are also available on Scribbler Hub for live experimenting using online compiler: [https://hub.scribbler.live/portfolio/#!nikoscham/FEAScript-Scribbler-examples](https://hub.scribbler.live/portfolio/#!nikoscham/FEAScript-Scribbler-examples)

## Examples

### Heat Transfer (solidHeatTransferScript)

- **Heat Conduction Through a Wall**: 1D heat transfer through a wall with convection and constant temperature boundary conditions
- **Heat Conduction in a Two-Dimensional Fin**: 2D heat transfer in a cooling fin with symmetry, convection, and constant temperature boundary conditions

These examples are presented in the Scribbler blog post: [Heat Transfer Finite Element Simulations in JavaScript using FEAScript](https://scribbler.live/2025/08/25/Heat-Transfer-Finite-Element-Simulations-in-JavaScript-using-FEAScript.html)
