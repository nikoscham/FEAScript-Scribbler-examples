# FEAScript-Scribbler-examples

This repository showcases a collection of finite-element analysis (FEA) examples built with [FEAScript](https://feascript.com/) and designed to run on [Scribbler](https://scribbler.live/)â€”an interactive JavaScript notebook environment with pre-loaded scientific libraries.

You can also explore and run these examples live on Scribbler Hub: [https://hub.scribbler.live/portfolio/#!nikoscham/FEAScript-Scribbler-examples](https://hub.scribbler.live/portfolio/#!nikoscham/FEAScript-Scribbler-examples)

## Examples

### Heat Transfer (heatConductionScript)

- **Heat Conduction Through a Wall**: 1D heat transfer with convection and constant temperature boundary conditions
- **Heat Conduction in a Two-Dimensional Fin**: 2D heat transfer in a cooling fin with symmetry, convection, and constant-temperature boundaries
